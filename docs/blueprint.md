- Primary color: Use a saturated blue (#29ABE2) to reflect the collaborative and communal aspects of the club.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF) provides a clean and open feel.
- Accent color: Use a vibrant orange (#FFA500) for interactive elements to draw attention and encourage engagement.
- Use 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for both headings and body text.
- Employ a responsive design that ensures optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- Simple, flat icons to represent different club sections and actions.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience. For example, a gentle fade-in effect when new photos are loaded or menu items are selected.
